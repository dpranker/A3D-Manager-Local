# Analogue 3D Firmware Changelog

This document tracks discovered changes to the Analogue 3D's internal formats,
SD card structure, and settings across firmware versions.

## 3D OS 1.5.1

Release Date: September 2026

### SD Card Changes

- 3D OS update files (`a3d_os_MM_mm_pp.bin`) are moved from the card root to
  `/System/Archived/` after updating (from the release notes; not yet observed
  on a card). Earlier versions left the update file in the root.
- Library customization for Unknown Cartridges via per-game `library.json`
  (see [Analogue's platform docs](https://www.analogue.co/developer/docs/platform/library-json)).
